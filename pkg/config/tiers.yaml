# Plasma Shield Permission Tiers
#
# Agents are assigned to tiers. Rules are applied based on tier.
# Higher tiers have more permissions (fewer restrictions).

tiers:
  # COMMODORE: Fleet orchestration AI
  # Broad internet access, can coordinate fleet — but CANNOT access the shield
  # The shield is invisible to the Commodore. It does not know it exists.

    cloud_apis: allow      # Can call Hetzner, AWS, GCP, etc.
    inter_agent: allow     # Can communicate with any agent
    shell_services: allow  # Can use ngrok, tunnels (for debugging)
    shield_access: deny    # Cannot access, perceive, or disable the shield
    priority: 100          # Higher = more permissive (network only, not shield)

  # Can orchestrate their fleet, no cloud API access
